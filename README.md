# US Candy Distributor - SQL-Based Project

## Project Overview
The **US Candy Distributor SQL Project** is a data analysis project centered around SQL queries. Using sales and geospatial data from a candy distributor, the goal of this project is to explore and analyze the data through a series of SQL queries, providing actionable insights into shipping efficiency, product margins, and sales performance.

## Project Theme
This project focuses on **optimizing shipping routes**, analyzing **product margins**, and identifying areas for improvement in the candy distributorâ€™s operations using SQL. It is designed for data engineers to practice and showcase their SQL skills in solving real-world business problems.

## Key Features
- **Efficient Factory-to-Customer Shipping Routes**: Analyze shipping routes between factories and customers using SQL to identify the most and least efficient routes.
- **Product Margin Analysis**: Use SQL to calculate profit margins for products and identify which product lines generate the highest margins.
- **Factory Relocation Insights**: Analyze the current factory-to-customer distribution and recommend product line reallocation based on efficiency and cost.
- **Sales Target Achievement**: Query sales data to determine how well the distributor is meeting targets and where improvements can be made.

## Tools and Technologies
- **SQL Server**: For querying and analysis,Join multiple tables to combine relevant data,Perform aggregations, calculations, and filtering to derive insights.
- **Python**: For data cleaning and transformations.
- **Microsoft Excel**: For initial data exploration and formatting.

## Schema Overview
This project uses multiple related tables, each containing valuable information for the analysis.

1. **Candy_Factories**  
   Contains factory locations with geographic data (latitude, longitude) to help optimize shipping routes.
   
2. **Candy_Products**  
   Provides detailed information about products, their pricing, and manufacturing factories.
   
3. **Candy_Sales**  
   Records sales transactions, including order details, shipment dates, product sales, and costs.
   
4. **Candy_Targets**  
   Holds target sales data for each division, enabling performance tracking and comparison.
   
5. **US_zips**  
   Geospatial data about US zip codes includes city, state, population, and geographic coordinates to support route analysis.

## Analysis and Insights
The key areas for analysis in this project are:

- **Factory-to-Customer Shipping Route Optimization**  
  Analyzing shipping routes between candy factories and customer locations to identify the most and least efficient routes. Optimize these routes by considering shipping costs, travel distances, and factory capacity.

- **Product Margin Analysis**  
  Calculate the margins for each product by comparing unit costs with unit prices, and identify the most profitable product lines.

- **Factory Relocation Strategy**  
  Suggest which products should be moved to different factories based on their shipping efficiency and geographic location, potentially reducing overall transportation costs.

- **Sales Target Achievement**  
  Analyze how well the candy distributor is meeting sales targets for different product divisions and recommend improvement strategies.

## Credits
- **Maven Analytics** for providing the dataset and allowing us to explore this real-world business problem.
- **US Candy Distributor** for their data-driven approach to enhancing logistics and product sales.
- **Data Engineers and Analysts** who contributed to curating and analyzing the dataset.

## License
This dataset is provided under the **Public Domain** license, allowing you to use and share the data freely for educational and analytical purposes.

## Conclusion
This project offers a comprehensive look at data engineering in a logistics and product sales context. By working with real-world data, you will gain valuable insights into optimizing factory locations, shipping routes, and product margins, all while refining your skills as a data engineer.
